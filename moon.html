      The Moon is the only natural satellite of Earth. It orbits around Earth at
      an average distance of 384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi),[f] a distance
      roughly 30 times the width of Earth. It completes an orbit (lunar month)
      in relation to Earth and the Sun (synodically) every 29.5 days. The Moon
      and Earth are bound by gravitational attraction, which is stronger on the
      sides facing each other. The resulting tidal forces are the main driver of
      Earth's tides, and have pulled the Moon to always face Earth with the same
      near side. This tidal locking effectively synchronizes the Moon's rotation
      period (lunar day) to its orbital period (lunar month).
